# AWS WAF / AppSec Labs

This repository contains hands-on AWS WAF and application security labs focused on
real-world threat mitigation, tuning, and automation.

The goal is to demonstrate practical WAF operations:
- Correct Web ACL design and attachment
- Rule priority and evaluation logic
- OWASP-aligned protections using managed rules
- Observability through logging and metrics
- Safe rollout strategies to reduce false positives
- Infrastructure-as-Code for repeatable WAF deployments

These labs are written from an operator’s perspective, focusing on
what actually matters in production environments.
